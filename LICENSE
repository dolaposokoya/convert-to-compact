### **Code Explanation**

**`convertToKMB(amount: number)`**:

- **Purpose**: Converts large numbers into readable abbreviations (K, M, B).
  
- **Logic**:
  - If the number is in the range of thousands (6 digits), it appends 'K' and divides by 1,000.
  - If the number is in the range of millions (7–9 digits), it appends 'M' and divides by 1,000.
  - If the number is in the range of billions (10–12 digits), it appends 'B' and divides by 1,000.
  - Numbers less than 1,000 are returned as a string without modification.
